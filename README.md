** SFML MUST BE INSTALLED AND PLACED INTO THE ROOT FOLDER **

A game I created in my first year, using SFML and a very basic framework provided. It's a small 8-bit esq gladiatorial game, where you have kill the enemy gladiator whilst collecting bottles of wine he stole from you, that give you points and buffs. The aim is the kill the enemy to win. Major mechanics of the game is getting the enemy to follow the player and run away from the player when they pick up a buff, and also the spawning in of the bottles. The game uses keyboard and mouse input, has animated sprites and uses collision/detection response to click buttons, pick up items and deal damage. The game has multiple game screens, some which depend on certain win/lose conditions. The unique mechanics this game has is that the enemy switches between perusing the player and running away from them when theyâ€™re buffed, and also the item pickup system that generates random spawn point for the bottles.
